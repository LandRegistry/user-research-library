# About

The insights library is a place for the user research team at Land Registry to share, discover and learn from each other's research.

By adding our user research to the library, we can:

* collect all our research in one place
* develop a consistent, searchable way of storing insights
* inform research carried out across projects
* avoid duplicating research across projects
* improve the way we carry out research in future
* share best practice and support everyone in the community.

This current version of the library is an alpha that came out of a six-week discovery process in November and December 2020.

# Guidelines

## Adding research to the library

Below, you find some of the key guidance on adding research to the library. You can read the full guidelines in a Word document.

## Submit your research

You can add new research to the library by completing a short form. As the library is currently an alpha, you will have to complete the form each time you want to add a new artefact.

## Preparing your documents

When you submit the form, you will be asked to include a short executive summary of the artefact and the research it relates to. We recommend you think about or write that summary in advance.

You will also need to make sure your research artefact is hosted on Microsoft Teams. The document should have its permissions set so anyone with a Land Registry email address can view it. It can be stored in any Teams folder.

## Which research artefacts to add

The current version of the library allows you to add and search for the following research artefacts.

* Discussion guides
* Journey maps
* Personas
* Playback slides
* Snapshots
* User needs

As we develop the library, we may decide to add more artefact types. Email the library team with suggestions if something is missing.

## Where to store research artefacts

For security reasons, all documents linked to from the library should be stored in Microsoft Teams and SharePoint. It does not matter which folder they are in on Teams, so long as the documentâ€™s permissions are set correctly.

Do not include links to documents on other platforms or services, such as Google Drive, Trello and Mural. You can convert those research artefacts to a PDF then store them on Microsoft Teams.

## Editing library entries

For the current version of the library, only members of the library team can make changes once a research artefact is added. If you contact them with your edits, they will be able to update the library for you.
