# HMLR User Research Insights Library

This user research insights library contains artefacts created by the user research team at HM Land Registry. It is an alpha service, which means we're currently testing it out and all feedback is welcome. Feel free to explore.

## About the library

The insights library is a place for the user research team at Land Registry to share, discover and learn from each other's research.

By adding our user research to the library, we can:

* collect all our research in one place
* develop a consistent, searchable way of storing insights
* inform research carried out across projects
* avoid duplicating research across projects
* improve the way we carry out research in future
* share best practice and support everyone in the community.

This current version of the library is an alpha that came out of a six-week discovery process in November and December 2020.

## Contact
